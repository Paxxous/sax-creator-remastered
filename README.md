# Remastered Sax creator

I couldn't find a good audio library for c++, and it got me frusturated so I'm moving back to python lol. C++ Is such an ancient languange and I don't want to go through the trouble of reading so many crusty 20 year old tutorials and downloading libraries from websites that look like they were made by one year ago me.

This is just going to be a complete rewrite of the original.
